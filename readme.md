• Adjustable array size and animation speed
• Pause / Resume functionality
• Displays time & space complexity and basic performance metrics
• Responsive UI (works on desktop and mobile)

🎨 Color Legend

• 🔵 Unsorted elements
• 🔴 Comparing
• 🟠 Swapping
• 🟢 Sorted
• 🟣 Pivot (Quick Sort)

🛠️ Tech Stack

• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript (ES6)
